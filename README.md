# Sports Scheduler

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to manage sports and sessions associated with those sports. Users can create, edit, list, and delete sports. They can also create, edit, list, and delete sessions within each sport. The application provides separate sections for listing sessions created by other users, sessions created by the user, canceled sessions, and joined sessions.

The application also includes authentication features, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and log out. Users can join sessions, leave sessions, cancel sessions, and uncancel them as needed. Custom error pages are provided to handle any errors that may occur during the user's interaction with the application.
